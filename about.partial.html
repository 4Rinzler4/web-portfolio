        I am a beginner frontend developer currently studying at SoftServe
        Academy. I’m working on building my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
        along with other essential technologies for modern web development. My
        goal is to gain a solid foundation in frontend development, learn best
        practices, and create projects that showcase my growing expertise. I’m
        passionate about creating responsive, user-friendly web interfaces and
        am eager to understand how to build engaging and efficient applications.
        My studies at SoftServe Academy have introduced me to the fundamentals
        of web development, and I am actively learning about tools like Git,
        frameworks like React. I’m enhancing my coding skills, problem-solving
        abilities, and understanding of industry standards. I look forward to
        applying my knowledge to real-world projects and contributing to
        innovative digital solutions as I continue growing in the field.
